In the "display(GLAutoDrawable)" method if the mouse is clicked (mouseClick) 
then the shade and corresponding shape is redrawn to the window, "drawShape()".
Display gets the pixel value of the mouse using the 
"glReadPixels(int, int, int, int, int, int, Buffer)". If the pixel value equals
the byte value (255) then the mouse has been clicked on the shape, since the
shape has been painted that color.
